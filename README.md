# DeepDelver  
### An automated Static & Dynamic Malware Analysis tool  

> “Mining the Depths of Malware, One Byte at a Time.”

---

## Overview  

**DeepDelver** is a hybrid malware analysis tool built for cybersecurity research and education.  
It performs static and dynamic analysis of suspicious exe files extracting metadata, inspecting PE headers, scanning for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and safely executing files to observe real-world behavior.  

---

## Proposed Features  

### Static Analysis  
- File metadata extraction (size, timestamps, architecture)  
- Cryptographic hash calculation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.)  
- PE header parsing (sections, entry points, imports)  
- Entropy calculation with YARA rule scanning  
- String and URL extraction with risk classification  
- Import table inspection for suspicious API usage  

### Dynamic Analysis  
- Controlled execution within a sandboxed VM  
- Real-time process, file system, and registry monitoring  
- Network traffic capture (via Wireshark / PyShark)  
- API call tracing and event logging  
- Auto snapshot restore for post-analysis isolation  

### Reporting  
- Generates clear, comprehensive reports 
- Severity grading (Low / Medium / High / Critical)  
- Aggregated view of static + dynamic findings
